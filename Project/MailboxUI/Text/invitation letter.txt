If you are receiving this, it means you are invited to the first event of canopy. But what is such a prestigious event even about?


This is an in-person event where you will create a platformer in Godot. If you're new to the engine then it will be the perfect introduction, and if you're experienced, it will be a fun opportunity to see how far you can push the idea of a platformer. It's taking place In two locations, we will start at the 55 and second coworking space, and move to the salesforce park for dinner. It will last 8 hours, going from 10am to 6pm. There will be lunch and dinner provided at no cost, and there will be three tokens given out to each person who stays the whole duration.

Climb this branch to get one step closer to the Canopy, we hope to see you there!
