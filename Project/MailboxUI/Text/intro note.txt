CANOPY is a game-focused week full of fun workshops, game creation, and new friends. We’re running three events: Intro to Godot, Workshop Day (3D assets in Blender + Intro to Godot UI), and a Group Game Jam. Attend any of these Canopy events and you’ll earn free-use stipends to spend however you like next week.
