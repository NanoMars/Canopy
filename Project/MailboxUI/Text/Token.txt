Free-use stipends let you spend your tokens on anything you likeâ€”meals, attractions, travel, or whatever you choose. You earn them as physical wooden tokens by joining Canopy events all week. Each token is worth $5 in stipend cash. At the end of the week, simply turn in your tokens to claim your stipend and spend it however you want.
